# Lexical-Analyzer
The lexical analyzer generator is required to automatically construct a lexical analyzer from a regular expression description of a set of tokens. The tool is required to construct a nondeterministic finite automata (NFA) for the given regular expressions, combine these NFAs together with a new starting state, convert the resulting NFA to a DFA, minimize it and emit the transition table for the reduced DFA together with a lexical analyzer program that simulates the resulting DFA machine.
